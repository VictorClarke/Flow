# FLOW

ML agent that finds shortest corresponding paths of same grouped points with no intersections.
This is a python search agent that uses an A* heuristic to match alike colored markers on an NxN grid.

FLOW IMAGE python file takes an image capture of the original grid in which the alike color markers (two of each color) are scattered randomly throughout.
Contains two functions in which the various colors, locations, and the grid itself is produced.

FLOW SOLVER python file takes the puzzle as an argument and outputs the paths of the corresponding colors.
